                <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
                <p>College students themselves, the founders of College Curios 
                    saw how their and their friends' rooms were slowly becoming 
                    cluttered from excess items. They listened to the financial 
                    plights of other students and how they struggled to find 
                    affordable products as Burlington's cost of living continues 
                    to rise. In the struggles of their student body, the founders 
                    saw an opportunity to help their fellow students while investing 
                    in their community at the same time, and so created College Curios, 
                    a site by students, for students, whose proceeds go towards our community.

                <h2>What is the Vermont Children's Trust Foundation?</h2>
                <p> The VCTF is a local organization whose mission is to raise money to support 
                    Vermont children and their families. They fund programs that ensure families 
                    are stable and supported, as well as those that help children and teenagers 
                    reach their full potential.

                <h2>You Choose What You Pay</h2>
                <p>We at College Curios understand that university students aren't 
                    exactly swimming in cash. We would hate for someone to not be able 
                    to afford our wares, which is why we let the consumer choose how much 
                    they are willing to donate, with a minimum of two dollars. This way, College Curios 
                    can raise money for charity and support local college students at the 
                    same time!
